Language: Azure KQL

Products: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Required: DeviceEvents, DeviceProcessEvents, DeviceNetworkEvents


## Description

The below query detects potential Kerberos relaying event chain generated by [KrbRelay](https://github.com/cube0x0/KrbRelay).



## How to use theÂ query
The query doesn't ouput all the raw events because of the logic implementation. It displays only the DCOM process creation. You can change the logic if you like. To see all the raw events, use the analysis query below.



**Query for Detection:**
